        <p class="line1">Did you know that about 40 % of the food produced in India is wasted?
          Approximately 84.7% of the total food waste recorded was thrown in the bin. <br>
          There can't be the scarcity of food on the Earth it's only mis-management, which Our team is working to
          rectify and pave the way for a brighter future. Our goal is to intelligently connect the needy with his need,
